Code Book:

This code book describes the variables of the data set, and any transformations performed to clean up the data set.The 
overall script for this project can be roughly summarized as follows:

           1.The training and test set are are first comnied into one data set using concatination.
           2. Extracting the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each sample. 
           3.Samples with the same activity_name and subject_id are reduced to the corresponding mean value
           4. Then we finally create an independent tidy data set which we would be saving as the text file.
 
About the Data set:

The studies were carried out on a group of 30 participants ranging in age from 19 to 48 years old. Each participant wore a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) 
around their waist and did six activities (WALKING, WALKING UPSTAIRS, WALKING DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING). They collected the 
3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a confluence using its integrated accelerometer and gyroscope at a constant rate of 50Hz. 

The sensor data (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed with noise filters before being sampled in 2.56 sec fixed-width sliding windows with 50 percent overlap (128 readings/window). 
A Butterworth low-pass filter was used to separate the sensor acceleration signal into body acceleration and gravity, which had both gravitational and body motion components.
Because it is assumed that the gravitational force has only low frequency components, a filter with a cutoff frequency of 0.3 Hz was utilised. Calculating variables from the time and frequency domain 
yielded a vector of characteristics from each frame.


The final output dataframe with all the features is shown in 1.png 2.png and 3.png uploaded in this repo.
